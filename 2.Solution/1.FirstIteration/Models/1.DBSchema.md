# MonitorMe - Database Schema

## Entities:

- Hospital
- Patient
- VitalSign
- MonitoringDevice
- NurseStation
- Alert
- SleepStatus

## Attributes:

## Hospital:

- HospitalID (Primary Key)
- Name
- Location

## Patient:

- PatientID (Primary Key)
- Name
- Age
- Gender
- AdmissionDate
- DischargeDate

## VitalSign:

- VitalSignID (Primary Key)
- Type (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, etc.)
- Value
- Timestamp
- PatientID (Foreign Key referencing Patient)

## MonitoringDevice:

- DeviceID (Primary Key)
- Type
- TransmissionRate
- PatientID (Foreign Key referencing Patient)

## Nurse:

- StationID (Primary Key)
- Location
- MaxPatients
- NureseName
- PatientID

## Alert:

- AlertID (Primary Key)
- Type (e.g., decrease in oxygen level)
- Description
- Timestamp
- PatientID (Foreign Key referencing Patient)

## SleepStatus:

- SleepStatusID (Primary Key)
- Status (e.g., sleep or awake)
- Timestamp
- PatientID (Foreign Key referencing Patient)

## Relationships:

- Each Hospital has multiple Patients.
- Each Patient has multiple VitalSigns, Alerts, and SleepStatus entries.
- Each MonitoringDevice is associated with one Patient.
- Each NurseStation can monitor multiple Patients.
- Each Alert is linked to one Patient.
- Each SleepStatus entry is linked to one Patient.

## Additional Considerations:

Proper indexing and optimization should be implemented for efficient data retrieval, especially for historical vital sign readings.
Data storage solutions should be chosen based on the on-premises architecture, considering factors such as scalability and reliability.
Data processing mechanisms need to analyze vital signs, detect issues, and trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds.
The system should include mechanisms to filter and query historical data based on time range and vital sign type.
