# Requirements

1. Introduction

    The MonitorMe Medical Patient Monitoring System aims to provide comprehensive and efficient monitoring of vital signs for patients within hospital settings. The following requirements outline the key functionalities and characteristics of the system.

2. Functional Requirements

-   2.1 Data Sources
    - Heart Rate Monitoring: The system must read heart rate data from patient monitoring devices every 500ms.
    
    -   Blood Pressure Monitoring: Blood pressure readings should be obtained from patient monitoring devices every hour.

    -   Oxygen Level Monitoring: MonitorMe should read oxygen level data from devices every 5 seconds.

    -   Blood Sugar Monitoring: The system must collect blood sugar readings from monitoring devices every 2 minutes.

    -   Respiration Rate Monitoring: Data on respiration rate should be obtained from patient monitoring devices every second.

    -   ECG Monitoring: The system must capture ECG data every second.

    -   Body Temperature Monitoring: Readings of body temperature should be collected every 5 minutes.

    -   Sleep Status Monitoring: MonitorMe must acquire sleep status data from devices every 2 minutes.
    
-   2.2 Data Consolidation and Display
    -   Consolidated Monitoring Screen:
        -   The system should display consolidated vital sign data on a centralized monitoring screen per nurse's station.
    -   Rotation between patients on the screen should occur every 5 seconds.
    -   Each nurse's station can monitor a maximum of 20 patients.

-   2.3 Data Recording
    -   Historical Data Storage:
    -   MonitorMe must record and store the past 24 hours of all vital sign readings for each patient.
    -   Medical professionals should be able to review this history, filtering on time range as well as vital sign.

-   2.4 Alerting Mechanism

    -   Issue Detection:

        -   The system must analyze vital signs and alert medical professionals if it detects an issue (e.g., decrease in oxygen level).

    -   Threshold Alerts:

        -   MonitorMe should notify medical professionals when vital signs reach preset thresholds (e.g., temperature reaches 104 degrees F).

    -   Context-Aware Analysis:

        -   Alerting should consider the patient's state (awake or asleep) for trend and threshold analysis.

        2.5 Monitoring Device Transmission Rates
    -   Transmission Frequency:
        -   Ensure that each patient monitoring device transmits vital sign readings according to the specified rates.

-   2.6 Deployment

    -   On-Premises Deployment:

        -   MonitorMe will be deployed as an on-premises system.

        -   Each physical hospital location will have its own installation of the complete MonitorMe system, including recorded raw monitoring data.

    -   Instance Capacity:

        -   The system should support a maximum of 500 patients per physical MonitorMe instance.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

-   3.1 Performance
    -   Response Time:

        -   The system must achieve an average response time of 1 second or less for displaying vital sign data on the consolidated monitoring screen.
    
-   3.2 Scalability

    -   System Scalability:
        -   Design the system to handle a maximum of 500 patients per physical instance.
    
-   3.3 Compliance
    -   Regulatory Compliance:
        -   Ensure that the system complies with relevant medical and healthcare regulations and standards.

-   4. Future Considerations

    -   Technical Solution Flexibility:
        -   The platform, data stores, databases, and other technical tools and products are unspecified and subject to future considerations.
