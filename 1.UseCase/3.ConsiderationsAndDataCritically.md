# Considerations and Data Criticality

## Considerations

1.  Data Transmission Limitations:

    -   Patient monitoring devices may operate in environments with limited internet connectivity. As a result, the system should be designed to function seamlessly even in scenarios where internet access is sporadic or unavailable.

2.  Manual Data Handling:

    -   Certain aspects of the monitoring devices, such as obtaining data from SD cards and managing device charging, involve manual steps. The system design should accommodate these manual processes and ensure smooth integration into the overall workflow.

3.  Internet Access for Monitoring Devices:

    -   While the monitoring devices are expected to have access to the internet when available, the system should gracefully handle situations where internet connectivity is intermittent or not present.

## Data Criticality

### Data Type Criticality Observation

-   Vital Sign Data from Monitoring Devices:

    -   Critical: Must be continuously available for real-time patient monitoring and timely medical interventions.

-   Consolidated Monitoring Screen Data:

    -   Critical: Data displayed on the consolidated monitoring screen per nurse's station must be consistently accessible for medical professionals.

-   Historical Vital Sign Data:

    -   Critical: Past 24 hours of vital sign readings must be available for medical professionals to review, supporting data-driven decision-making.

-   Alerting and Notification Data:

    -   Critical: Data related to alerts and notifications, including issue detection and threshold alerts, must be always available to ensure prompt response by medical professionals.

-   Monitoring Device Transmission Data:

    -   Critical: Ensure reliable transmission and availability of data from patient monitoring devices according to specified rates.

-   System Performance and Response Time Data:

    -   Critical: Continuous monitoring of the system's performance and response times is essential to ensure timely delivery of vital sign information.

-   Deployment and Instance Data:

    -   Critical: Data related to the on-premises deployment and instance capacity must be available for system administrators and maintainers.

### Future Considerations

-   Technical Solution Flexibility:
    -   As the platform, data stores, and other technical tools are unspecified, future considerations may include adapting the system to evolving technologies and industry standards.
