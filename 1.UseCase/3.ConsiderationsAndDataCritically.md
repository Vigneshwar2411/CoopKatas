# Considerations and Data Criticality

## Considerations

1.  Data Transmission Limitations:

    -   Patient monitoring devices may operate in environments with limited internet connectivity. As a result, the system should be designed to function seamlessly even in scenarios where internet access is sporadic or unavailable.

2.  Manual Data Handling:

    -   Certain aspects of the monitoring devices, such as obtaining data from SD cards and managing device charging, involve manual steps. The system design should accommodate these manual processes and ensure smooth integration into the overall workflow.

3.  Internet Access for Monitoring Devices:

    -   While the monitoring devices are expected to have access to the internet when available, the system should gracefully handle situations where internet connectivity is intermittent or not present.

## Data Criticality

### Data Type Criticality Observation

-   Vital Sign Data from Monitoring Devices:

    -   Critical: Must be continuously available for real-time patient monitoring and timely medical interventions.

-   Consolidated Monitoring Screen Data:

    -   Critical: Data displayed on the consolidated monitoring screen per nurse's station must be consistently accessible for medical professionals.

-   Historical Vital Sign Data:

    -   Critical: Past 24 hours of vital sign readings must be available for medical professionals to review, supporting data-driven decision-making.

-   Alerting and Notification Data:

    -   Critical: Data related to alerts and notifications, including issue detection and threshold alerts, must be always available to ensure prompt response by medical professionals.

-   Monitoring Device Transmission Data:

    -   Critical: Ensure reliable transmission and availability of data from patient monitoring devices according to specified rates.

-   System Performance and Response Time Data:

    -   Critical: Continuous monitoring of the system's performance and response times is essential to ensure timely delivery of vital sign information.

-   Deployment and Instance Data:

    -   Critical: Data related to the on-premises deployment and instance capacity must be available for system administrators and maintainers.

-   Low Latency:

    -   To achieve low latency, focus on optimizing data retrieval and processing times. Implement efficient indexing on critical fields in the database to speed up queries related to real-time vital sign data.
    -   Consider utilizing in-memory databases or caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need to fetch it from slower storage systems.

-   Order of Information is Very Critical:

    -   Establish a clear order for storing and retrieving information to ensure that critical data, such as real-time vital sign readings, is prioritized. This involves implementing a robust timestamping mechanism to maintain the chronological order of data entries.
    -   Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to quickly access the most recent information, as medical professionals often need to view the latest patient data promptly.

-   Reliability:

    -   Design the system with redundancy and failover mechanisms to enhance reliability. Consider deploying the system across multiple servers or instances to ensure continuous operation even if one component fails.
    -   Implement regular monitoring and alerting for system health to proactively identify and address potential issues before they impact reliability.

-   Fault-Tolerant Databases (Secondary Auxiliary Collection if One is Failing):

    -   Employ a fault-tolerant database system that supports replication and clustering. This ensures that if one database node fails, another can seamlessly take over, preventing data unavailability.
    -   Set up a secondary auxiliary collection or database instance to act as a backup. In case the primary database encounters issues, the system can automatically switch to the secondary database to maintain continuous data availability.

-   Data Archival of Beyond 1 Month History (Patient has Checked Out):

    -   Implement a data archival strategy to move historical patient data beyond the 1-month threshold to a separate archival storage system. This helps in managing the database size and optimizing performance.
    -   Use a tiered storage approach where recent data is stored in high-performance databases for quick access, while older data is moved to slower, cost-effective storage solutions.
    -   Ensure that archived data remains accessible for authorized personnel, enabling them to retrieve historical information even after a patient has checked out.

### Future Considerations

-   Technical Solution Flexibility:
    -   As the platform, data stores, and other technical tools are unspecified, future considerations may include adapting the system to evolving technologies and industry standards.
