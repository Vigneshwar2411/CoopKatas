# Goals, Drivers

# Background

StayHealthy, Inc. is now expanding into the medical monitoring market, and is in need of a new medical patient monitoring system for hospitals that monitors a patients vital signs using proprietary medical monitoring devices built by StayHealthy, Inc.
 
- MonitorMe reads data from eight different patient-monitoring equipment vital sign input sources: heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, blood sugar, respiration rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, and sleep status (sleep or awake). It then sends the data to a consolidated monitoring screen (per nurses station) with an average response time of 1 second or less. The consolidated monitoring screen displays each patients vital signs, rotating between patients every 5 seconds. There is a maximum of 20 patients per nurses station.
- For each vital sign, MonitorMe must record and store the past 24 hours of all vital sign readings. A medical professional can review this history, filtering on time range as well as vital sign.
- In addition to recording raw monitoring data, the MonitorMe software must also analyze each patient's vital signs and alert a medical professional if it detects an issue (e.g., decrease in oxygen level) or reaches a preset threshold (e.g., temperature has reached 104 degrees F).
- Some trend and threshold analysis is dependent on whether the patient is awake or asleep. For example, if the blood pressure drops, the system should notice that the patient is asleep and adjust its alerts accordingly.

# Goals

- Improved Patient Monitoring:

    - Ensure real-time and accurate monitoring of vital signs for patients, leading to proactive identification of health issues or abnormalities.
    - Enhance the overall quality of patient care by providing timely and relevant information to medical professionals.

-   Efficient Alerting and Response:

    -   Implement an intelligent alerting mechanism to promptly notify medical staff about potential issues or when vital signs exceed preset thresholds.
    -   Improve response times for medical professionals to address critical situations and provide timely interventions.

-   Data-Driven Decision-Making:

    -   Facilitate evidence-based decision-making by recording and storing the past 24 hours of vital sign readings.
    -   Empower medical professionals to analyze historical data, identify trends, and make informed decisions regarding patient care.

-   Context-Aware Monitoring:

    -   Ensure contextual analysis of vital signs based on the patient's state (awake or asleep) to avoid unnecessary alerts during periods of normal variation.

-   Scalability and Accessibility:

Design the system to handle a maximum of 500 patients per physical instance, allowing scalability to meet the diverse needs of different hospitals.
Enable easy deployment and accessibility of the system within each hospital's premises.

-   Comprehensive Monitoring Solution:

Provide a holistic solution that covers a range of vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, blood sugar, respiration rate, ECG, body temperature, and sleep status.
Offer a consolidated monitoring screen for medical professionals to efficiently track multiple patients simultaneously.
